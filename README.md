### Installation

First things first, let's get this package installed:

```bash
composer require llm-agents/agent-symfony-console
```

### Setup in Spiral Framework

To get the Site Status Checker Agent up and running in your Spiral Framework project, you need to register its
bootloader.

**Here's how:**

1. Open up your `app/src/Application/Kernel.php` file.
2. Add the bootloader like this:
   ```php
   public function defineBootloaders(): array
   {
       return [
           // ... other bootloaders ...
           \LLM\Agents\Agent\SymfonyConsole\Integrations\Spiral\SymfonyConsoleBootloader::class,
       ];
   }
   ```

And that's it! Your Spiral app is now ready to use the agent.
